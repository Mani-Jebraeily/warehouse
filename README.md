# Warehouse Management Frontend (Next.js)

A frontend simulation of a warehouse management system built with **Next.js**.  
This project integrates with a real backend API that was initially provided as a local project and I manually deployed  on a Node.js hosting environment.  
The frontend itself is deployed on **Vercel** and available as a live demo.
